# MRM_2025_XCAT_Cardiac_Stimulation
Simulated data published in MRM article "Electromagnetic and electrophysiological modeling of cardiac stimulation thresholds in 13 MRI gradient systems and 56 body models" by V. Klein, M. Davids, N. G. Ferris, J. Edmonson, M. Gebhardt, D. Rattenbacher, J. S. van den Brink, M. Steckner, L. L. Wald, B. Guerin (2025). The first spreadsheet contains mean and standard deviation of cardiac stimulation (CS) thresholds simulated in all body models in units of (T/m) for each gradient system (GC#1-GC#13) and each rise time, as well as the predicted gradient amplitude associated with a 2 ppb probability of inducing CS. The remaining spreadsheets contain hyperbolic and exponential E-field fit parameters (rheobase, chronaxie/time constant, fit RMSE) as well as parameters of the log-normal fits to the predicted CS thresholds at each rise time (mu and sigma) as well as the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
